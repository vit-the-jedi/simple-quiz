# simple-quiz
small quiz created to tailor offers to users based on the answers chosen.


# Usage 
Be sure that the id's in your project match the id's within the demo folder. The core js looks for these fields to fill in the questions and retrieve values.

# Customization
Feel free to update the promptList object with your custom questions + values. It is reccommended that you chose values that you feel represent the answers.

All values must be number values - the js adds all values at the end of the quiz to make decisions based on the total amount.

Feel free to update the if else conditions within finishPrompts() function to reflect your desired outcome + updated promptList.values.
